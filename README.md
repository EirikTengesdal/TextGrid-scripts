# *Praat* TextGrid-scripts for Python
This repository contains Python scripts for generating and modifying [*Praat*](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) `TextGrid` files.

The most elaborate script is `TextGrid_script.py`, which is based on `CSVtoTextGrid.py`.

## About the main script `TextGrid_script.py`
[`TextGrid_script.py`](https://github.com/EirikTengesdal/TextGrid-script/blob/9f0d19e679d5abca6229ac721563ebf8401eecd8/TextGrid_script.py) is used in a project which involves using the online forced alignment app [*Autophon*](https://autophon.se/). The script is thus an example of how to operationalise project specific tasks.

This repository is made public in a preliminary state, and will be dynamic during the project period. Still, feel free to raise issues, create forks and/or make pull requests.

### Generating `TextGrid` files
The script enables the user to generate `TextGrid` files based on data contained within an input CSV file.
It also here presupposes that the corresponding audio files already are located within a folder, from which the audio file duration is extracted per file. This step can be replaced with other code for instance if the input CSV file already contains this information.

### Modifying `TextGrid` files
The script enables the user to modify pre-existing `TextGrid` files. It adds and/or manipulates `IntervalTier` and `PointTier` object variables.
It also features translation of `realization` labels in Norwegian into English via Google Translate (with `googletrans`: `Translator`).

## About the script `CSVtoTextGrid.py`
[`CSVtoTextGrid.py`](https://github.com/EirikTengesdal/TextGrid-script/blob/9f0d19e679d5abca6229ac721563ebf8401eecd8/CSVtoTextGrid.py) is the precursor to `TextGrid_script.py` and was originally used to generate TextGrids for longer audio files per participant.

(A related version of the script can be found in [my answer to a question on Stack Exchange about how to populate *Praat* TextGrid tiers based on another text file](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/a/48642).)

An adapted version of this script can be relevant to use when you do not require to modify pre-existing TextGrids, or other more complex operations.
